# Assets Directory

This directory should contain the following image files for the Expo app:

- **icon.png** (1024x1024) - App icon
- **splash.png** (1242x2436 or similar) - Splash screen
- **adaptive-icon.png** (1024x1024) - Android adaptive icon
- **favicon.png** (48x48 or larger) - Web favicon
- **notification-icon.png** (96x96) - Android notification icon

## Quick Setup

You can use a simple colored square or your logo for these files. 

For a quick start, you can:
1. Create simple PNG files with your brand colors
2. Use online tools like favicon.io or similar to generate icons
3. Use Figma or any image editor to create custom icons

The app will work without these files during development (you'll see warnings), but they're required for production builds.
